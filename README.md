# SimpleConjoint
Ignore index.html - I just use that to run code during development because it's easier than testing in Qualtrics if I don't need to. Once I hit the qualtrics specific features, I move it over to the survey. 

Intended to be used in the context of the Qualtrics QuestionAPI inside a survey to create conjoint experiments.
